## Description

_\<This assignment prompts us to complete the exercises from the computer science textbook. These exercises test our ability to write a code for the given information and to determine and fix bugs that may prevent a code from working.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<Through trial and error, I learned how to find and fix the bugs on Exercise 1.9 so that the codes would actually work. Also, I learned how to write my own codes and determine the mistakes and bugs I was making while writing them.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

_\<William Ochoa\>_
